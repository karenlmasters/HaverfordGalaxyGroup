# HaverfordGalaxyGroup
Code collaboration for the Galaxy Group at Haverford College

(Emily plots KLM Tweaked in HIMaNGA First Paper.ipynb) - Code to make plots in Masters et al. 2019 on HI-MaNGA. Mostly written by Emily Harrington BMC '20. 

FourPanelGalaxyPlot.ipynb Code to make a four panel plot for a MaNGA galaxy, showing the gri image and three other MaNGA maps.

KLM_RRL_PAandLength_Notebook.ipynb - Rachel Langgin BMC'23 uploaded her code to measure bar position angles from GZ:3D masks  

mpl_style.py - Style file for Matplotlib which may be useful (from Coleman Krawcyzk)

Pipe3D_access.ipynb - example notebook to access some Pipe3D analysis of MaNGA data

VAC_GZ3D_tutorial_KLMedits.ipynb - edits to the GZ3D VAC tutorial in Marvin so that it works on Sciserver.org

Metallicity_BinnedStatisticOverSamples.ipynb -- sample selection for spiral galaxies binned into arm winding level, loops over all galaxies in a sample and saves a metallicity trend for each. From Emmy Wisz BMC'23 senior thesis

Metallicity_MassBinning_LinearRegressionFits_FitsofFits.ipynb -- mass binning within subsamples, fitting a straight line to trends. From Emmy Wisz '23 senior thesis. 

RadialGradientsMaNGAEditedMar20.ipynb -- create a radial metallicity trend for one or multiple galaxies. Originally from KLM, minor changes by Emmy Wisz.

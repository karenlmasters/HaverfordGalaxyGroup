# HaverfordGalaxyGroup
Code collaboration for the Galaxy Group at Haverford College


## Example Codes Either Written to help, or output of student papers

* 1ADVICE.txt - advice to please read this README file! 

*  `Arm_Interarm_Tutorial.ipynb` -- tutorial to learn how to calculate excess in stellar mass density of spiral galaxy arms. By Ma≈°a Kilibarda '26 with edits by KLM https://github.com/karenlmasters/HaverfordGalaxyGroup/blob/main/Arm_Interarm_Tutorial.ipynb 

* `BinnedMedianExample.ipynb` - functions to apply binned statistics to data with an example use on some random data. By Emmy Wisz with some modifications from Karen Masters. https://github.com/karenlmasters/HaverfordGalaxyGroup/blob/main/BinnedMedianExample.ipynb

* `Fitsinput_simpleplots.ipynb` -- Example code for how to read in a fits file, slice the data on selection from a column, make basic histograms and scatter plots. Written for mangaHIall.fits file... but should be easily modified to any .fits table.  https://github.com/karenlmasters/HaverfordGalaxyGroup/blob/main/Fitsinput_simpleplots.ipynb

* `FourPanelGalaxyPlot.ipynb` -- Code to make a four panel plot for a MaNGA galaxy, showing the gri image and three other MaNGA maps. 
https://github.com/karenlmasters/HaverfordGalaxyGroup/blob/main/FourPanelGalaxyPlot.ipynb

* `HI-MassFraction-StellarMassPlot.ipynb` -- Simplified from `HIMaNGA_First_Paper_EmilyHarrington_KLM.ipynb` - just makes the HI mass fraction against stellar mass plot. https://github.com/karenlmasters/HaverfordGalaxyGroup/blob/main/HI-MassFraction-StellarMassPlot.ipynb 

*  `HIMaNGA_First_Paper_EmilyHarrington_KLM.ipynb` -- Code to make plots in Masters et al. 2019 on HI-MaNGA. Mostly written by Emily Harrington BMC '20. https://github.com/karenlmasters/HaverfordGalaxyGroup/blob/main/HIMaNGA_First_Paper_EmilyHarrington_KLM.ipynb


* `KLM_RRL_PAandLength_Notebook.ipynb` -- Rachel Langgin BMC'23 uploaded her code to measure bar position angles from GZ:3D masks  https://github.com/karenlmasters/HaverfordGalaxyGroup/blob/main/KLM_RRL_PAandLength_Notebook.ipynb

* `MaNGAGalaxyofTheDay.ipynb` -- Code by Karen Masters which mades a four panel plot of any input MaNGA galaxy. Hoping to use for a Bluesky bot for 'MaNGA galaxy of the day'. There are enough galaxies in the MaNGA sample to do this for almost 30 years. https://github.com/karenlmasters/HaverfordGalaxyGroup/blob/main/MaNGAGalaxyofTheDay.ipynb

* `Metallicity_BinnedStatisticOverSamples.ipynb` -- sample selection for spiral galaxies binned into arm winding level, loops over all galaxies in a sample and saves a metallicity trend for each. From Emmy Wisz BMC'23 senior thesis https://github.com/karenlmasters/HaverfordGalaxyGroup/blob/main/Metallicity_BinnedStatisticOverSamples.ipynb

* `Metallicity_MassBinning_LinearRegressionFits_FitsofFits.ipynb` -- mass binning within subsamples, fitting a straight line to trends. From Emmy Wisz '23 senior thesis. https://github.com/karenlmasters/HaverfordGalaxyGroup/blob/main/Metallicity_MassBinning_LinearRegressionFits_FitsofFits.ipynb

* `Pipe3D_access.ipynb` -- example notebook to access some Pipe3D analysis of MaNGA data (by KLM) https://github.com/karenlmasters/HaverfordGalaxyGroup/blob/main/Pipe3d_access.ipynb

* `RadialGradientsMaNGAEditedMar20.ipynb` -- create a radial metallicity trend for one or multiple galaxies. Originally from KLM, minor changes by Emmy Wisz. https://github.com/karenlmasters/HaverfordGalaxyGroup/blob/main/RadialGradientsMaNGAEditedMar20.ipynb

* `Radial_Metallicity_Rainbow_ex.ipynb` - the rainbow plot of metallicity trends in bins of galaxy stellar mass. From Emmy Wisz. https://github.com/karenlmasters/HaverfordGalaxyGroup/blob/main/Radial_Metallicity_Rainbow_ex.ipynb

*  `VAC_GZ3D_tutorial_KLMedits.ipynb` -- edits to the GZ3D VAC tutorial in Marvin so that it works on Sciserver.org (by KLM) https://github.com/karenlmasters/HaverfordGalaxyGroup/blob/main/VAC_GZ3D_tutorial_KLMedits.ipynb

* `basic_stats.py` -- Various useful statistics functions from Brooke Simmons. Includes a function to calculate proper errors on fractions, and to match two distributions (e.g. by mass). https://github.com/karenlmasters/HaverfordGalaxyGroup/blob/main/basic_stats.py

* `mpl_style.py` -- Style file for Matplotlib which may be useful (from Coleman Krawcyzk) https://github.com/karenlmasters/HaverfordGalaxyGroup/blob/main/mpl_style.py

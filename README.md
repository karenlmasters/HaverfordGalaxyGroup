# HaverfordGalaxyGroup
Code collaboration for the Galaxy Group at Haverford College


## Example Codes Either Written to help, or output of student papers

* `basic_stats.py` -- Various useful statistics functions from Brooke Simmons. Includes a function to calculate proper errors on fractions, and to match two distributions (e.g. by mass). 

* `Fitsinput_simpleplots.ipynb` -- Example code for how to read in a fits file, slice the data on selection from a column, make basic histograms and scatter plots. Written for mangaHIall.fits file... but should be easily modified to any .fits table.  

* `FourPanelGalaxyPlot.ipynb` -- Code to make a four panel plot for a MaNGA galaxy, showing the gri image and three other MaNGA maps. 
https://github.com/karenlmasters/HaverfordGalaxyGroup/blob/main/FourPanelGalaxyPlot.ipynb

* `HI-MassFraction-StellarMassPlot.ipynb` -- Simplified from above - just makes the HI mass fraction against stellar mass plot. 

*  `HIMaNGA_First_Paper_EmilyHarrington_KLM.ipynb` -- Code to make plots in Masters et al. 2019 on HI-MaNGA. Mostly written by Emily Harrington BMC '20. 


* `KLM_RRL_PAandLength_Notebook.ipynb` -- Rachel Langgin BMC'23 uploaded her code to measure bar position angles from GZ:3D masks  

* `Metallicity_BinnedStatisticOverSamples.ipynb` -- sample selection for spiral galaxies binned into arm winding level, loops over all galaxies in a sample and saves a metallicity trend for each. From Emmy Wisz BMC'23 senior thesis

* `Metallicity_MassBinning_LinearRegressionFits_FitsofFits.ipynb` -- mass binning within subsamples, fitting a straight line to trends. From Emmy Wisz '23 senior thesis. 

* `mpl_style.py` -- Style file for Matplotlib which may be useful (from Coleman Krawcyzk)

* `Pipe3D_access.ipynb` -- example notebook to access some Pipe3D analysis of MaNGA data (by KLM)

* `RadialGradientsMaNGAEditedMar20.ipynb` -- create a radial metallicity trend for one or multiple galaxies. Originally from KLM, minor changes by Emmy Wisz. 

*  `VAC_GZ3D_tutorial_KLMedits.ipynb` -- edits to the GZ3D VAC tutorial in Marvin so that it works on Sciserver.org (by KLM)
